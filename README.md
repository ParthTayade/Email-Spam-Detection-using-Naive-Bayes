# Email-Spam-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes

### Project Overview
This project implements an email spam detection system using Naive Bayes algorithm. Text data is preprocessed and transformed using text vectorization techniques to convert emails into features. The trained model classifies emails as spam or ham based on learned patterns, demonstrating an efficient and probabilistic approach to text classification.

### Dataset Source : KAGGLE Spam Collection Dataset

This dataset contains a collection of email messages labeled as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). It is designed for email spam detection and text classification tasks. Each record includes the raw email text along with its corresponding label, making it suitable for preprocessing, feature extraction, and training machine learning or NLP models.
