# Email-Spam-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes
This project implements an email spam detection system using Naive Bayes algorithm. Text data is preprocessed and transformed using text vectorization techniques to convert emails into features. The trained model classifies emails as spam or ham based on learned patterns, demonstrating an efficient and probabilistic approach to text classification.
